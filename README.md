## Project
I created a map to display the beautiful places that you can find in Round Rock TX.
Round Rock is a small city. But we have an outlet to shop and great facilities to practice sports, hospitals and all the things that we need.
This project was made using the following nanodegree projects as reference: CatClickerKnockout, Project_Code_6_SaticMapsAndStreetViewImagery.html, Project_Code_10_DisplayingRoutesDirectionsService.html, and
the minicourse-ajax-project. We did all these projects during the Nanodegree program.
I was frustrated several times; but following your advise about clear my mind and start again with fresh eyes, helped me a lot. It is so easy to get lost. I had problems with opening the marker when you clicked the name and of course, with the filterList.

### index.html:
This file uses the knockout framework. And this file loads the rest of the files and APIs to show the map.

### css/style.css
In his file you can see the format and general features of the page.

### js/app.js
This file has the model and the ViewModel of the project. Also handles the creation and function of the map. The markers and the info windows.
